# Algorithms-and-Models-for-Data-Analysis-Learning-and-Prediction

Analyzed data with specific algorithms (linear regression, k-nn, k-means) & evaluated and interpreted the error rates of the model (fit).
1. Linear Model : 
->Input: NHL Top 100 players 
->Output: Fitted Linear models
-> Processing: “lm” model of R, summary of metrics in a table and interpretation of the results.
2. K-nn classification German credit data obtained from Kaggle.
3. K-means clustering with Pew Data on Gaming , Jobs and Broadband
